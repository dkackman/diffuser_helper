                "A marmot, dressed in a small, red jacket and a tiny hat, sits on a wooden stool in a serene boreal forest. The marmot's fluffy paws strum a miniature acoustic guitar, producing soft, melodic tunes. Nearby, a few other marmots gather, watching curiously and some clapping in rhythm. Sunlight filters through the tall trees, casting a gentle glow on the scene. The marmot's face is expressive, showing concentration and joy as it plays. The background includes a small, flowing stream and vibrant green foliage, enhancing the peaceful and magical atmosphere of this unique musical performance.",
                "Illustrate “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci, but reimagine it with robots in a futuristic setting. Maintain the composition and dramatic lighting of the original painting, but replace the apostles with various types of androids and cyborgs. The table should be a long, sleek metal surface with holographic displays. In place of bread and wine, have the robots interfacing with glowing data streams."
